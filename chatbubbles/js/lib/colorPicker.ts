// produced by the same codegen, so its dependency map always starts with
//
//   [ ActionSheetActionCreators, <own function id> ]
//
// where the own function id is always module ID + 1 (`relative(1)`) and
// ActionSheetActionCreators always exposes the stable `openLazy` export. No module IDs are
// hardcoded anywhere in this resolver: the only drifting dependency (ActionSheetActionCreators)
// is located by its export names at runtime and the self-reference is structural, so the
// lookup survives Discord renumbering every module on every update.
//
// `withDependencies` runs in the exportsless scope, so it matches the still-uninitialized
// launcher and forces it to initialize; `withName` then confirms the real exports. Only
// success is cached.
